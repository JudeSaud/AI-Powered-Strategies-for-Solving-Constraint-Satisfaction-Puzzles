# AI-Powered-Strategies-for-Solving-Constraint-Satisfaction-Puzzles

This project presents an AI-based solution to the Tenner Grid puzzle, modeled as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Four algorithms—Simple Backtracking, Backtracking with MRV heuristic, Forward Checking, and Forward Checking with MRV—were implemented to solve randomly generated Tenner Grid puzzles of various sizes
